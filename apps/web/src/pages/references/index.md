Within the Realm framework, we divides references based on its functionality:

**`1. Elements`**  
These serve as the fundamental building blocks within Realm. By default, Realm provides a set of predefined elements that you can utilize in your application development.

**`2. Flows`**  
Flows are custom element tags specifically designed to facilitate event handling within the definition of a Custom Element. By incorporating flow tags, you can effectively manage and respond to various events that occur within your application.

**`3. Actions`**  
Actions, another type of custom element tag, play a crucial role in handling the business logic within your Custom Element definition. By utilizing action tags, you can implement and manage complex business operations, ensuring the seamless execution of your application's functionality.
