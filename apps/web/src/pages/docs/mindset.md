> In the spiritual realm nothing is indifferent: what is not useful is harmful ~ Leo Tolstoy

The mindset of a developer creating a product directly for customers differs from developers working within a company. This distinction forms the foundation and core mindset of Realm.

As a business owner, your priority is to deliver your product quickly and ensure customer satisfaction. While code issues can be addressed in the future, a strained relationship with your users is challenging to mend.

This is precisely why Realm was created—to assist you in shipping your product faster and leaving a positive first impression on your customers.

> Reality of things is hidden in the realm of the unseen ~ Hamza Yusuf

It's important to note that your customers are primarily concerned with the product itself, not the underlying code. Therefore, Realm may not be suitable for developers who heavily prioritize microsecond-level performance optimization in the frontend. Backend development is a different story, as even the slightest performance difference can have significant consequences. However, in the frontend, it's not as critical.

Perhaps you noticed some glitches or perceived lower code quality in the base codes of Realm. It's worth mentioning that Realm is designed to be lightweight, with a size of approximately 20kb (around 12kb when gzipped and minified). As the founder, I intentionally avoid making Realm more opinionated or complex just to reduce its size. Additionally, I have chosen not to create an API for it. My goal is to keep Realm simple and easily comprehensible.

After completing the initial iteration of Realm, I came to the realization that it may not be the perfect solution for every developer. However, it does serve as an excellent choice for indie makers who value swift product delivery. If you're a developer who prioritizes frontend performance, a robust API, and maintainable source code in the long run, I would recommend considering alternatives like React, Vue, or Svelte. These frameworks are well-established and cater to those specific requirements.

Remember, Realm is an open-source project, allowing anyone to contribute and improve it. I won't say much more. It's time for you to ship your product faster.

> Here’s what I know about the realm of possibility— it is always expanding, it is never what you think it is. Everything around us was once deemed impossible. From the airplane overhead to the phones in our pockets to the choir girl putting her arm around the metalhead. As hard as it is for us to see sometimes, we all exist within the realm of possibility. Most of the limits are of our own world’s devising. And yet, every day we each do so many things that were once impossible to us. ~ David Levithan
