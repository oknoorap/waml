description: Install and get started with Realm in just a few seconds.
---

To start using Realm, you only need a text editor (like Vim or VSCode), a web browser, and there's no need for a localhost setup (unless you're using the <anchor-link href="/docs/learn/reusability">`import-element`</anchor-tag> tag).

Getting started is a breeze! Just follow these simple steps:

1. Create a new HTML file.

2. Add the necessary scripts and styles from a CDN inside the `<head>` tag of your HTML file.

3. Double-click the HTML file to open it in your web browser.

That's it! You're now ready to dive into Realm.

## CDN Installation

Add the following code to your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@realmorg/realm/dist/realm.production.min.js"></script>
<link
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@realmorg/realm/dist/realm.min.css"
  rel="stylesheet" />
```

With Realm installed, let's create your very first custom element. <anchor-link href="/docs/learn">Let's get started</anchor-link>!
