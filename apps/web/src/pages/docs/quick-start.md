All you need is a text editor (Vim or VSCode, whatever), a web browser, and no localhost setup (unless you're using the <anchor-link href="/docs/learn/reusability">`import-element`</anchor-link> tag).

To get started, create a new HTML file and place the necessary scripts and styles from a CDN inside the `<head>` tag. Then, simply double-click the file to open it in your browser. That's it! You're all set to begin working with Realm.

## CDN Installation

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@realmorg/realm/dist/realm.production.min.js"></script>
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@realmorg/realm/dist/realm.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

Now let's create your first custom element. <anchor-link href="/docs/learn">Let's go!</anchor-link>
